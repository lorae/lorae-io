Hi, I'm Lorae! I'm a Research Specialist in Princeton University's Eviction Lab, in the sociology department. I have a bachelor's degree in economics from Harvard University, and previously worked in macroeconomic policy research at the Brookings Institution. This is my (very brand new) website.

I study how Americans navigate housing choices. I'm also interested in the underlying mechanics driving real estate markets, and in policy measures that can improve our housing affordability, stability, and access.
